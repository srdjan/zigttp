## Why this matters

`ModuleCompiler.compileAll` (the multi-file `import`-graph compiler, used whenever a handler imports another local file, including during `zigttp dev` live-reload) is otherwise careful: it sets up `errdefer` cleanup for its parser/codegen lists specifically so a later error unwinds cleanly, and its caller in `zruntime.zig` wraps the whole call in `catch |err| { log; return err; }`. But it constructs each per-module parser with `zts_parser.JsParser.init(...)`, which is defined as `initFallible(...) catch unreachable` — a panic, not an error, on the one fallible step inside `initFallible` (an allocation in `ScopeAnalyzer.initFallible`). A panic here bypasses every `errdefer` in `compileAll` and the caller's `catch` entirely, aborting the process. `docs/internals/architecture.md` documents that `zigttp dev` "Compilation failures keep the currently serving handler active" — an OOM here breaks that guarantee by crashing the whole dev server instead of just failing the one reload.

## Current state

- `packages/zigts/src/modules/internal/compiler.zig:71`:
  ```zig
  var js_parser = zts_parser.JsParser.init(self.allocator, source);
  ```
  inside `pub fn compileAll(self: *ModuleCompiler, graph: *module_graph.ModuleGraph) !CompileResult` (`compiler.zig:47-90`), which already has `errdefer` blocks at `compiler.zig:52, 56-59, 61-64` for the `compiled`/`parsers`/`codegens` lists.
- `packages/zigts/src/parser/parse.zig:113-115`:
  ```zig
  pub fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, source: []const u8) Parser {
      return initFallible(allocator, source) catch unreachable;
  }
  ```
- `packages/zigts/src/parser/parse.zig:117-135` — `pub fn initFallible(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, source: []const u8) !Parser`, the non-panicking version, already exported and already used elsewhere in the codebase (the version that should be called instead).
- `packages/runtime/src/zruntime.zig:753-788` — `compileAndRunFileImports`, the sole caller of `ModuleCompiler.compileAll` in the codebase (confirmed: `packages/zigts/src/modules/root.zig:34` only re-exports the type; `zruntime.zig:784` is the only call site). The call already has a `catch |err| { std.log.err(...); return err; }` wrapper (`zruntime.zig:784-787`) that a real error from `compileAll` would flow into cleanly — it is only the `unreachable`-panic inside `JsParser.init` that defeats this.

## Commands you will need

| Purpose | Command | Expected on success |
|---|---|---|
| Build | `zig build` | exit 0 |
| zigts tests | `zig build test-zigts` | success |
| ZRuntime tests (compileAndRunFileImports caller) | `zig build test-zruntime` | success |
| Format gate | `zig fmt --check build.zig packages/` | no output |
| Full local gate | `bash scripts/verify.sh` | exit 0 |

## Scope

**In scope, the only files/directories to modify:**

- `packages/zigts/src/modules/internal/compiler.zig` — change line 71 from `JsParser.init(...)` to `try JsParser.initFallible(...)`, and adjust the surrounding code as needed so the function still returns `!CompileResult` correctly on this new error path (it already does — `compileAll`'s signature is already `!CompileResult`).

**Out of scope:**

- `packages/zigts/src/parser/parse.zig` — `Parser.init`/`initFallible` themselves are correct as written and used intentionally elsewhere (the panicking `init` is a legitimate convenience wrapper for call sites that have already made allocation failure fatal by design, e.g. top-level CLI entry points). Do not remove or change `Parser.init`.
- Any other caller of `Parser.init` in the codebase — this plan only touches the one call site inside `ModuleCompiler.compileAll` that sits behind an `errdefer`/`catch` chain that a panic defeats. Do not sweep other `JsParser.init` call sites without separately verifying each one's caller actually expects a recoverable error (some may be legitimately fine as-is).
- `zruntime.zig:753-788` (`compileAndRunFileImports`) — its existing `catch` is already correct; no change needed there once the panic is removed at the source.

## Git/workflow guidance

- Branch: work on `main`.
- Commit style: Conventional Commits, e.g. `fix(zigts): stop the module compiler panicking on parser-init allocation failure`.
- Do not push or open a PR unless the operator asks.

## Steps

### Step 1: Switch to the fallible constructor

In `compiler.zig:71`, change:
```zig
var js_parser = zts_parser.JsParser.init(self.allocator, source);
```
to:
```zig
var js_parser = try zts_parser.JsParser.initFallible(self.allocator, source);
```
Confirm this doesn't change any other observable behavior of `compileAll` for the non-error case (the return type of `initFallible` is `!Parser`, same `Parser` value as `init` returns on success, just wrapped in an error union).

**Verify**: `zig build test-zigts test-zruntime` -> success.

### Step 2: Add a regression test

Add a test that drives `ModuleCompiler.compileAll` (or `compileAndRunFileImports`, whichever is more directly testable with a controlled allocator) with a `std.testing.FailingAllocator` configured to fail on the allocation inside `Parser.initFallible`, and assert that `compileAll` returns an error rather than the test process aborting. Model the failing-allocator harness after existing tests in this codebase that already use `std.testing.FailingAllocator` (search for it in `zruntime.zig` or `context.zig` for the established pattern per this repo's testing conventions).

**Verify**: `zig build test-zigts` (or `test-zruntime`, matching wherever the test lands) -> success; the new test must fail (panic) against the pre-fix code (temporarily revert Step 1 locally to confirm, then reapply) — do not skip this red-proof.

## Test plan

- New test exercising `ModuleCompiler.compileAll` under a `FailingAllocator` tuned to fail during parser construction, asserting a clean error return.
- Regression: proven to panic on the pre-fix code, pass after the fix (Step 2 red-proof).
- Final: `bash scripts/verify.sh` -> exit 0.

## Done criteria

All must hold:

- [ ] `compiler.zig:71` calls `JsParser.initFallible` via `try`, not the panicking `JsParser.init`.
- [ ] A multi-file-import compile that fails to allocate during parser construction returns a normal Zig error, observable by `compileAndRunFileImports`'s existing `catch`, instead of aborting the process.
- [ ] `zig build test-zigts test-zruntime` exit 0.
- [ ] `bash scripts/verify.sh` exit 0.
- [ ] New test proves the fix, red-proven against the pre-fix panic.
- [ ] No files outside the in-scope list are modified.
- [ ] `plans/README.md` status row updated.

## STOP conditions

Stop and report if:

- Current-state excerpts do not match the live code (re-check line numbers first).
- The new test's file (`compiler.zig` has zero existing `test` blocks today) turns out not to be collected by any `zig build test-*` step, per this repo's known "CLI test-collection closure" gotcha (a file reached only via a named-module boundary, not a relative `@import` chain from a test root, can have its `test {}` blocks silently uncollected). If your new test doesn't appear in any test runner's output/count, check whether `packages/zigts/src/root.zig` (the `test-zigts` root) actually reaches `modules/internal/compiler.zig` transitively; if not, add a `test { _ = @import("modules/internal/compiler.zig"); }` anchor block in a file that root.zig's test root does reach (mirroring the fix already applied for `zigts_cli.zig`/`describe_rule.zig`/`search_rules.zig`, see `plans/README.md`'s "Findings Surfaced During Execution" note), and report that you did so.
- A step's verification fails twice after reasonable local correction.

## Maintenance notes

- This is a narrow, single-call-site fix. If a future audit wants to sweep all `Parser.init` call sites for the same panic-vs-error question, that should be a separate plan, since each caller needs its own reachability/blast-radius check (some may be genuinely fine as fatal-on-OOM by design).
